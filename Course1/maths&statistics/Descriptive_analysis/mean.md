MEAN(Average)

Definition

The mean is the sum of all values divided by the number of values.
You get the mean by adding up all the numbers and then dividing it by the totality of the numbers
example:

Your five friends have these candies:
Friend 1: 5
Friend 2: 10
Friend 3: 8
Friend 4: 12
Friend 5: 15
Add them: 5 + 10 + 8 + 12 + 15 = 50

There are 5 friends, so divide: 50 ÷ 5 = 10

Mean = 10 candies each (on average).This means that if we decide to share the candies equally without cheating anyone, then Everyone gets a fair share if you share all candies equally!.

Good things about Mean:
It uses every single number. Great when data is nice and even.

example 2:

school scores
maths = 50
english = 70
biology = 80

Add them: 50 + 70 + 80 = 200

then we will divide the total scores by the number of subjects

200 / 3 = 66.666666667

👉 Most people think mean = typical value
Tricky thing: It can get pulled by super big or super small numbers

## In-Depth Explanation of mean.md
Focused on the mean (average), this file defines it as the sum of values divided by count, with candy and school score examples. It highlights pros (uses all data) and cons (affected by outliers).

**Expanded Details**:
- **Mathematical Foundation**: Mean = Σ(x_i) / n, where Σ is sum, x_i are values, n is count. It's the balance point of data on a number line.
- **Calculation Steps**:
  1. Sum all values.
  2. Divide by total count.
  3. For weighted mean (advanced): Multiply each value by its weight before summing.
- **Pros**:
  - Comprehensive: Incorporates every data point, making it precise for symmetric distributions.
  - Algebraic Properties: Easy to manipulate (e.g., mean of sums = sum of means).
  - Useful in Physics: Center of mass analogy.
- **Cons**:
  - Outlier Sensitivity: A single extreme value (e.g., billionaire in salary data) inflates the mean, misrepresenting the "typical" person.
  - Not Robust: In skewed data (e.g., income distributions), median is often better.
- **Examples Expanded**:
  - Candies: Fair sharing assumes equal distribution; mean ensures equity.
  - School Scores: 66.67 average indicates overall performance but masks subject strengths.
  - Real-World: Stock market returns — average annual return might look good, but volatility (via standard deviation) tells the risk story.
- **When to Use**: For normally distributed data (bell curve). Avoid for ordinal data or when outliers exist.
- **Common Mistakes**: Confusing with median; forgetting units (e.g., mean height in cm vs. inches).
- **Advanced Note**: In probability, mean relates to expected value. For large datasets, sample mean estimates population mean.

This file teaches the most intuitive measure but wisely warns about its limitations, encouraging critical thinking.
