6️⃣ WHY AVERAGES CAN LIE 😏 (The Sneaky Part!)

This is the most important warning!
Mean can trick you if there are extreme numbers.
Famous Candy Story Gone Wrong:
Four friends have: 5, 5, 5, 5 candies.
Mean = 5. Perfect! Everyone happy.
Now a super rich kid joins with 100 candies.
Numbers: 5, 5, 5, 5, 100
Add up: 120 ÷ 5 = 24 mean.
"Wow! On average, everyone has 24 candies!"
But really? Four kids still have only 5, one has 100. Most kids feel poor!
Median? Line up: 5,5,5,5,100 → Middle is 5. Tells the true story!
Mode = 5.
See? Mean "lied" because of one big number.
This happens in real life:

Average salary in a company: Boss earns millions, workers earn little → Average looks high, but most people earn low.
"Average house price" in a city with some mansions.

Always check all three: Mean, Median, Mode — they tell different parts of the story!
Sometimes median is better for "typical" person.

Classwork:

7️⃣ Quick Game: Find Mean, Median, Mode!
Let's play with these test scores: 70, 85, 90, 85, 100

Line up (already sorted): 70, 85, 85, 90, 100
Mean: Add = 430 ÷ 5 = 86
Median: Middle one = 85
Mode: 85 appears twice = 85

All close together — good data!
Another one: 10, 20, 30, 40, 1000
Mean pulled up high! Median = 30 (much fairer).
8️⃣ Your Turn! Mini Exercise 😊
Try these (say answers out loud or write):

What are the three measures of central tendency?
For numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10:
Mean?
Median?
Mode?

For favorite colors: Red, Blue, Red, Green, Red
Mode?

## In-Depth Explanation of summary.md
This file warns about averages lying, using the candy story to show mean distortion. It includes classwork and exercises on mean, median, mode.

**Expanded Details**:
- **Core Warning**: Measures of central tendency can mislead if not contextualized. Mean assumes symmetry; outliers break this.
- **The Candy Example**: Illustrates Simpson's paradox in simple terms — mean hides inequality.
- **Why Averages Lie**:
  - Skewness: Right-skewed data (e.g., incomes) pulls mean right; median stays central.
  - Outliers: One extreme value dominates (e.g., celebrity salaries inflate averages).
  - Sample Bias: Non-representative data leads to false "averages."
- **Balancing Measures**: Always compare mean, median, mode. If they differ, investigate (e.g., median < mean indicates right skew).
- **Classwork Breakdown**:
  - Test Scores: Close values show normal distribution; mean/median/mode align.
  - Extreme Example: Mean 164 vs. median 30 — highlights robustness.
- **Exercises**: Reinforces concepts; encourages verbal/written practice.
- **Broader Lessons**: Teaches critical thinking — stats aren't absolute truths. In data science, this prevents poor decisions (e.g., policy based on misleading averages).
- **Practical Tips**: Use visualizations (e.g., box plots) to spot lies. In Excel/Python, compute all three easily.
- **Advanced Note**: This ties into variance/standard deviation for spread. For deeper analysis, consider interquartile range (IQR) to quantify outlier impact.

This file wraps up with actionable exercises, emphasizing that stats require scrutiny.
Can you find mean or median? (Hint: colors are labels!)

Why might median be better than mean sometimes?

Bonus: Think of something in your life (like pocket money or game scores) where average might trick you!
