1️⃣ WHAT IS DATA?

Data is raw facts or observations collected for analysis.

Think of data as unprocessed information.
Data is like little pieces of information that we collect, just like you collect stickers, Lego bricks, or shiny stones from the playground.
By itself, a pile of stickers doesn’t tell a story.
But when you look at them carefully, you can learn cool things!

Super Easy Examples:
Your marks in school: 10, 8, 9 ⭐
How much your toys cost: ₦500, ₦200, ₦1000 🧸
Names of your friends: Tomi, Ada, Chidi 👋
Answers like “Yes” or “No” to “Do you like ice cream?” 🍦
Your birthday: 5th January 🎂

All these are data!
Data is just raw stuff.
It’s like flour, eggs, and sugar before you mix them to make cake.
By itself → boring.
When we mix and look at it → yummy information!

2️⃣ Why Do We Care About Data?
Because data helps us make smart choices instead of just guessing!
Imagine you have a small shop that sells sweets 🍬.
You notice: “Hmm… I sell fewer sweets on Mondays. Why?”

If you guess → “Maybe kids don’t like Mondays!” (could be wrong)
If you use data → You write down how many sweets you sell every day:

Monday: 5 sweets
Tuesday: 20 sweets
Wednesday: 18 sweets
Thursday: 22 sweets
Friday: 30 sweets 😋
Now you can see the pattern! Mondays are low.
Maybe you can put a special “Monday Happy Deal” to sell more.
That’s called smart decisions with data — no more guessing games!

Data helps:

Teachers know who needs extra help
Doctors know what medicine works best
Parents know what games you like most
Even football coaches know which player runs fastest ⚽

3️⃣ TYPES OF DATA

1:
Number family(Numerical or Quantitative):

This is data you can count or calculate with.
Examples:

==> How old you are: 5, 6, 7 years old
==> How many candies you have: 3, 10, 0 😢
==> How tall you are: 1 meter 20 cm
==> Temperature outside: 28 degrees 🌞

You can add them: 5 candies + 3 candies = 8 candies 🍬
You can compare: “I have more candies than you!”

2:
Label Family (Categorical or Qualitative):

These are just names or groups. You can’t do math with them.
Examples:

==> Boy or Girl
==> Favorite color: Red, Blue, Yellow 🌈
==> Yes or No
==> School subjects: Math, English, Art
==> Types of animals: Dog, Cat, Bird 🐶🐱🐦

You CAN’T say Red + Blue = Purple in math. That doesn’t work!
Let’s play Quick Check Game! 🧠

I’ll show you some data. You tell me which family it belongs to.

1. Age → Number Family! (you can count years)
2. Gender (Boy/Girl) → Label Family!
3. Monthly pocket money → Number Family! (you can add it)
4. Name of your favorite subject → Label Family!

NUMBER FAMILY(NUMERICAL OR QUANTITATIVE) are of two types

1. Discreet(countable):

    These are whole numbers you can count one by one, like fingers on your hand.
Examples:

Number of brothers and sisters you have (1, 2, 3… you can’t have 2.5 sisters!)
Number of goals in a football match: 0, 1, 2, 3
How many pets you have

You count: 1, 2, 3… done!

2. Continous(measurable numbers):

    These can have tiny bits and decimals, because you measure them with a ruler or scale.
Examples:

Your height: 1.15 meters, 1.16 meters, 1.155 meters… it can be any tiny bit taller
Your weight: 20.5 kg
Time to run to school: 5.2 minutes
How much water in a cup: 250.75 ml

These never stop exactly — you can always measure a little more or less.

examples:

Name,Age,Gender,Score in Test
Ayo,  7,  Boy,    85
Zainab,8, Girl,   92

now lets sort them into families

Name → Label Family (just names!)
Age → Number Family → Counting kind (whole years)
Gender → Label Family (Boy/Girl)
Score → Number Family → Counting kind (whole marks, usually no decimals)

NOTE: As a data analyst, always ask ==> “Can I do math with it?” and “Is it countable or measurable?”
