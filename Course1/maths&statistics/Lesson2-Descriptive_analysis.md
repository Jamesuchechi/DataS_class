        LESSON 2 -- DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS

This is where data starts talking. It helps us to summarise occurencesit is the act of:

Summarizing data

Understanding patterns

Describing what’s happening

Instead of looking at 1,000 numbers, we use a few smart values.        

It's like summarizing a long storybook with just a few sentences.
Imagine you and your friends collect 100 candies, but counting them one by one takes forever.
Instead, you say: "On average, each friend has about 10 candies!"
That's descriptive statistics — quick summaries that help us understand data fast.

We use it for:

School reports (like average marks in class)
Shops (average sales per day)
Games (average points in a season)
Even weather (average temperature in a month)

It helps spot patterns, compare things, and make decisions.

TYPES OF DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS
1. MEAN
2. MEDIAN
3. MODE

MEAN(Average)

Definition

The mean is the sum of all values divided by the number of values.
You get the mean by adding up all the numbers and then dividing it by the totality of the numbers
example:

Your five friends have these candies:
Friend 1: 5
Friend 2: 10
Friend 3: 8
Friend 4: 12
Friend 5: 15
Add them: 5 + 10 + 8 + 12 + 15 = 50

There are 5 friends, so divide: 50 ÷ 5 = 10

Mean = 10 candies each (on average).This means that if we decide to share the candies equally without cheating anyone, then Everyone gets a fair share if you share all candies equally!.

Good things about Mean:
It uses every single number. Great when data is nice and even.

example 2:

school scores
maths = 50
english = 70
biology = 80

Add them: 50 + 70 + 80 = 200

then we will divide the total scores by the number of subjects

200 / 3 = 66.666666667

👉 Most people think mean = typical value
Tricky thing: It can get pulled by super big or super small numbers

MEDIAN(Middle number):

The median is the middle number when data is arranged in order. i.e is the middle number when you arrange numbers from the smallest to the biggest.

Examples:

Example (Odd number of values)

2, 4, 6, 8, 10
Median = 6

Example (Even number of values)

2, 4, 6, 8
Median = 4 + 6 = 10
10/2 = 5

so median = 5

Why Median is cool:
It doesn't care about super big or small numbers. It's like the "real middle" of the group.
Great for things like house prices or salaries — where one super rich person doesn't trick you.

MODE(Popular Number):

Mode is the number that appears the most times.
It's like the most popular favorite color in class.

Example:

5, 8, 10, 12, 15 → Each appears only once. No mode! (Or we say "no mode")

New Example: Favorite Fruits in Class 🍎🍌
Apple: 6 kids
Banana: 10 kids
Orange: 4 kids
Mango: 10 kids
Banana and Mango both have 10 → Mode = Banana and Mango (bimodal — two modes!)

Example

2, 3, 3, 5, 7
Mode = 3

👉 A dataset can have:

One mode

More than one mode

No mode

Why Mode is fun:
Perfect for label data too! Like most common shoe color or favorite animal.
Tricky thing: Sometimes no mode, or many modes.



6️⃣ WHY AVERAGES CAN LIE 😏 (The Sneaky Part!)

This is the most important warning!
Mean can trick you if there are extreme numbers.
Famous Candy Story Gone Wrong:
Four friends have: 5, 5, 5, 5 candies.
Mean = 5. Perfect! Everyone happy.
Now a super rich kid joins with 100 candies.
Numbers: 5, 5, 5, 5, 100
Add up: 120 ÷ 5 = 24 mean.
"Wow! On average, everyone has 24 candies!"
But really? Four kids still have only 5, one has 100. Most kids feel poor!
Median? Line up: 5,5,5,5,100 → Middle is 5. Tells the true story!
Mode = 5.
See? Mean "lied" because of one big number.
This happens in real life:

Average salary in a company: Boss earns millions, workers earn little → Average looks high, but most people earn low.
"Average house price" in a city with some mansions.

Always check all three: Mean, Median, Mode — they tell different parts of the story!
Sometimes median is better for "typical" person.

Classwork:

7️⃣ Quick Game: Find Mean, Median, Mode!
Let's play with these test scores: 70, 85, 90, 85, 100

Line up (already sorted): 70, 85, 85, 90, 100
Mean: Add = 430 ÷ 5 = 86
Median: Middle one = 85
Mode: 85 appears twice = 85

All close together — good data!
Another one: 10, 20, 30, 40, 1000
Mean pulled up high! Median = 30 (much fairer).
8️⃣ Your Turn! Mini Exercise 😊
Try these (say answers out loud or write):

What are the three measures of central tendency?
For numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10:
Mean?
Median?
Mode?

For favorite colors: Red, Blue, Red, Green, Red
Mode?
Can you find mean or median? (Hint: colors are labels!)

Why might median be better than mean sometimes?

Bonus: Think of something in your life (like pocket money or game scores) where average might trick you!
You are now a descriptive statistics superstar! 🌟
These tools help data analysts summarize huge piles of data quickly.
